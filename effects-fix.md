# Effects Fix Plan

## Issues Identified
1. **Reverb and Room Size Effects**: The new effects were added but may not be fully integrated into the audio chain.
2. **Knob Initialization**: The knobs for the new effects may not be properly initialized or linked to their audio parameters.
3. **Audio Chain**: The connections between nodes (oscillator, delay, reverb, etc.) may be incomplete or incorrect.

## Steps to Fix
1. **Initialize Reverb and Room Size Effects**:
   - Ensure the `convolverNode` is created and connected to the audio chain.
   - Verify the `createReverbImpulse` function is called with the correct parameters.

2. **Set Up Knob Controls**:
   - Add event listeners for the new knobs (`reverbAmount` and `roomSize`).
   - Link the knobs to their respective audio parameters using `updateAudioParameter`.

3. **Test the Audio Chain**:
   - Verify all nodes are connected in the correct order: `oscillator → delay → reverb → gainNode → destination`.
   - Test each effect individually to ensure they work as expected.

## Code Changes Needed
1. **Add Missing Initialization**:
   - Ensure `convolverNode`, `wetGainNode`, and `dryGainNode` are created and connected.
   - Call `createReverbImpulse` with the initial room size value.

2. **Update Knob Setup**:
   - Add knobs for `reverbAmount` and `roomSize` to the `setupKnobControls` function.
   - Ensure the `updateDisplay` function handles the new effect values.

3. **Test and Debug**:
   - Add logging to verify each effect is working correctly.
   - Test the app with different knob settings to ensure smooth functionality.

## Next Steps
- Implement the changes outlined above.
- Test the app thoroughly to ensure all effects are working as expected.
- Document any additional issues or improvements needed.
